        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (1 1/2 inch) piece fresh turmeric root, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and grated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground turmeric</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine turmeric root, ginger root, and honey together in a bowl, crushing the turmeric and ginger as much as possible.</li>
            <li>Heat almond milk in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Once small bubbles begin to form around the edges, reduce heat to low. Transfer about 2 tablespoon milk to turmeric mixture to allow mixture to soften and honey to melt into a paste-like mixture.</li>
            <li>Mix the turmeric paste into milk in the saucepan; raise temperature to medium-low and cook, stirring continuously, until fully combined. Blend with an immersion blender for a smooth texture.</li>
            <li>Pour turmeric tea into a mug and top with ground turmeric and cinnamon.</li>
        </ol>
