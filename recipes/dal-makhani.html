    <p>Ever go to an Indian restaurant and wonder how they make those lentils? I hated lentils before I discovered Indian food. Then I scoured the internet to figure out how they achieved them, and through mixing and matching recipes and methods on videos, I've arrived at this recipe, which I think is pretty close. This version is very rich, but you can leave out the cream to make it lighter. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup lentils</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry kidney beans</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ghee</li>
        <li>4 cardamon pods, broken</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
        <li>4 bay leaves</li>
        <li>6 whole cloves</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons garlic paste</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup canned tomato puree, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ground coriander</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons dried fenugreek leaves (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place lentils and kidney beans in a large bowl; cover with plenty of water. Soak for at least 2 hours or overnight. Drain.</li>
        <li>Cook lentils, kidney beans, 5 cups water, and salt in a pot over medium heat until tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Remove from heat and set aside. Keep the lentils, kidney beans, and any excess cooking water in the pot.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook cumin seeds in the hot oil until they begin to pop, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and cloves; cook until bay leaves turn brown, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add ginger paste, garlic paste, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Stir tomato puree into spice mixture; cook over medium heat until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder, coriander, and butter; cook and stir until butter is melted.</li>
        <li>Stir lentils, kidney beans and any leftover cooking water into tomato mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low. Stir fenugreek into lentil mixture. Cover saucepan and simmer until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Add cream and cook until heated through, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
